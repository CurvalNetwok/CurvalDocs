# Curval: Ethereum â†” Curval

Curval native bridge between Ethereum and Curval is used to relay the Curval native token from Curval to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Curval bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Curval tokens between the Curval chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Curval or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Curval tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Curval chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Curval chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Curval chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Curval chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

## How to use

On Curval you send native Curval token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Curval token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Curval token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Curval native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
